# VRPrototype

This repository contains the materials we use to evaluate our prototype of VR system design ideas. The prototype method and study design can be found in the paper "Enhancing communication and facilitation of VR experiences in collaborative settings between HMD users and non-users." 

The materials consist of 2 main components: materials for presentation task and materials for interaction task.

## Presentation Task
For the presentation task, the presenter will present about 3 maps at a time. Please see Comprehension Quiz.pdf to see which 3 maps correspond to each quiz. The maps can be found in /Maps folder. The presenter should let the audiences about the meaning of the color code of the map as specified at the top of Comprehension Quiz as well as give examples of quiz questions to the audiences before starting the presentation, in order for the audiences to focus on certain types of information more than others. After finishing with the presentation, the audiences should complete 5 quiz questions as listed in Comprehension Quiz.pdf file.

## Interaction Task
After finishing with the quiz, the audiences should be given the picture of the same 3 maps but with stars to specify where the presenter should put the stickers on. This could be found in /Maps For Sticker Task folder.
